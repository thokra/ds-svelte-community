## Development

> [!WARNING]
> Dependabot PR-s are enabled for visibility, but merging them will cause errors with tests etc. This is because we're using Bun, and
> Dependabot doesn't know how to handle it. To update dependencies, you need to do it manually.

We use [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) to manage dependencies and run scripts.

Run `asdf install` to install the correct version of `bun`. (You might need to run `asdf plugin add bun` first.)

We have configured `bun` to also create a `yarn.lock` file, which is only used by Dependabot, as it doesn't support `bun` yet.

### Packages

The library is split into multiple packages in the `packages` directory. Each package has its own `README.md` with more information.

| Package                                 | Description                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ds-svelte-community`                   | The actual component library, including icons.                      |
| `ds-svelte-community-preprocess-svelte` | A preprocessing step that optimizes usage of the component library. |
